\begin{quote}
My goal is to establish and solve the stochastic optimal control problem that 
captures the momentum and order imbalance dynamics of the Limit Order Book 
(LOB). The solution will yield an optimal trading strategy that will permit
statistical arbitrage of the underlying stock, which will then be backtested on
historical data.

\section*{Whiteboard Inspirational Quote of the Week}

\section*{For Our Colleagues at Duke University...}
\paragraph{Mon 10th:} holy fuck two weeks today is the unofficial submission date. 

\paragraph{Tue 11th:} this morning i met up with Aerospace Adriana. she had texted me a couple days ago to say she was applying for the Forces, which i correctly guessed was for their aerospace engineering officer position, so i wanted to make sure she knew what she was getting herself into, what to expect from the application process and initially on joining, etc. turns out she literally knows nothing about anything. she didn't even bother really getting the job description, watching the little promo videos the CF has created for each job position. fucking idiot. but in other news she submitted her dissertation a month ago and her prof still hasn't even looked at it... so i dunno, i'm not even really that far behind then... \par 
i dunno whether you bother flipping through my actual thesis pdf when i attach it, it's pretty long so i imagine you probably did the first time and now it's like ``ehhh already seen it...'' so maybe i ought to just tell you what's new in it? or just stop attaching it! \par 
tentative meeting set up with Gabe for Monday morning. last i had talked to him, i hadn't even started doing the discrete time derivations. we're talking, i dunno, early July. holy fuck, i just realized that i've actually gotten a lot done. i still need a secondary examiner though. i contacted one prof by e-mail over the weekend and he has yet to reply, so next step will be dropping into his office, taking the foot in the door analogy to the next level.
