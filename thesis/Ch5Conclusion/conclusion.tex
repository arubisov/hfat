\section{Future Work}
MAKE A LIST: all the things you would change and do differently if to keep going with this research.
\begin{itemize}
\item lifting of MOs in backtest: right now we throw a random number. but really we should be maintaining our priority in the queue and checking whether we get executed. in particular, if delta=0, shouldn't be guaranteed execution.
\item calculating the h function, and therefore the deltas, for a larger time horizon than 100s...need to determine where it converges.
\item cutoff strategy early and utilize optimal liquidation from cts section.
\item latency lag for all executions, price feeds, etc...
\item market order cost. super easy to include, straight into DPE stopping region.
\end{itemize}
